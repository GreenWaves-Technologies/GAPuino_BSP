 * Over-The-Air2 (OTA2) Upgrade & Factory Reset Application
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------
 * PLEASE read the following documentation before trying
 * this application!
 * ------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * This application is used by the OTA2 Update Capability as a fallback
 * minimum extractor to fix a failed OTA2 extraction.
 *
 * Use case:
 *  OTA2 Extraction is in process
 *  Power outage or board reset happens and leaves the FLASH in an potentially unusable state
 *  - This is a potentially bad situation
 *     If the Apps LUT, Filesystem, OTA2 Extractor or Application Extraction was interrupted,
 *       the system may not work.
 *  - This extractor will be run by the bootloader to extract the ota2_extract application
 *     from either the Staged Area (if valid) or the Factory Reset and instructs the
 *     ota2_extract application to extract the Staged Area or Factory Reset Area (as appropriate)
 *
 * This application is meant to be programmed into the flash at Manufacture and not be updated.
 * As such, the ota2_extract application can never be compressed in the OTA2 image files, as this
 *   application does not know about decompression.
 *
 *   We can't count on anything of these being valid.
 *
 *   Apps LUT
 *   Resource Filesystem
 *   OTA2 extractor
 *   Application(s)
